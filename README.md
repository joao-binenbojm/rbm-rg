This repository will be used for all algorithm development, simulations and exploration required for my final year project: "A Mapping Between The Variational Renormalization Group and Deep Learning". This will include the exploration of RBMs/DBNs/DBMs models, MC simulations of the Ising Model, training on simulated data and carrying out statistical analysis on the results obtained.
